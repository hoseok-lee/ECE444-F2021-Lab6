# Pros of TDD

- Due to the nature of TDD, code will be a lot more modularized, encouraging the programmer to develop with good architecture
- Code will be better documented and easier to refactor, since the unit test will be written before the actual implementation
- Unit test will also help developers understand what they are truly trying to implement, and gain a deeper understanding of the overall project

# Cons of TDD

- In order to successfully implement TDD, every member of the team must perform TDD
- TDD is difficult to incorporate into legacy code that has already been thoroughly developed and implemented
- Writing unit tests and performing all the steps of TDD for every implementation and step in a project can be tiresome and time-consuming to maintain
